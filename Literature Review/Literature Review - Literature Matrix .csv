However, they say few studies pay attention to these multi-part features

Voronoi regions of a financial network. 
Rather than studying the dense structure of the network, 
they perform the analysis on the triangular maximally filtering of a financial network.","1.Coarse Graining: Coarse graining involves grouping 
vertices into non-overlapping

as a metric for measuring the curvature of paths or trajectories 
within a metric space, such as a network.
 It is used to capture geometric changes in the granular structure.

3.Filtering Techniques: Complete graph models in financial

 overcome this issue","In this paper, they use a discrete analogous Haantjes curvature of a curve

 from the seeding locations of the Voronoi cells.

"Predicting stock market movements
using network science: an information
theoretic approach",Minjun Kim and Hiroki Sayama,2017,"• The research aims to address the challenge of making reliable predictions of future movements in the Standard & Poor's 500 Index (S&P 500), which is a highly complex system with no clear pattern in price movements.
• The complex nature of the stock market makes it difficult to forecast its future movements accurately.
• The research focuses on constructing time-series complex networks of S&P 500 underlying companies and using network science and information theory to develop a method for predicting the future movements of the S&P 500.","• The study addresses the challenge of reliably predicting the future movements of the S&P 500, a highly complex system with no clear pattern in price movements.
• It introduces a new method to forecast future movements by constructing time-series complex networks of S&P 500 underlying companies, demonstrating the importance of network analysis in predicting stock market movements.

","• The stock market is a highly complex system with no clear pattern in price movements, making it challenging to predict future movements accurately.
• The research proposes a new method for forecasting the future movements of the S&P 500 by constructing time-series complex networks of S&P 500 underlying companies and using mutual information as link weights.
• Incorporating network measurements into ARIMA models improves the accuracy of index predictions, as shown by comparing the predictive power of ARIMA models with and without network measurements.
"," • The research used stock price records for 475 companies in the S&P 500 index, ranging from September 22nd, 2016 to October 11th, 2016, with 5340 one-minute interval closed prices for each company.

• The research discusses network analysis that forecasts future amplitudes of the S&P 500 changes to the one-hour future and helps improve the performances of ARIMA models
• Tools such as network science, information theory-based approaches, and statistical measures in Python were used for the analysis","• The study follows a systematic approach, starting with acquiring raw stock price records, pre-processing the data, computing pairwise mutual information of the stocks in the S&P 500, constructing networks using the mutual information as link weights, and building predictors using network centrality and modularity
• The researchers used the mutual information as link weights to capture the non-linear correlation of stock price movements and split the 5340-minute long time-series data into 60-minute long non-overlapping windows for each stock to compute mutual information of every stock pair
• The study aims to prove that network measurements indeed improve the ARIMA models and discusses the network analysis that forecasts future amplitudes of the S&P 500 changes to the one-hour future","• The study uses network science and information theory-based approaches to construct time-series complex networks of S&P 500 underlying companies using mutual information as link weights
